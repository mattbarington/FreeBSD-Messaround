ASSIGNMENT 3 DESIGN DOCUMENT
--------------------------------------
Brief Description:


------------------------------------
All files in REPO:
README                  - Directions for all compilation/running
design_doc.txt          - Full explanation of asgn3 implementation
Makefile                - Makefile with options to build and install 
                          kernel, and build benchmark
vm/vm_page.c		- Modified vm_page.c kernel source file
vm/vm_pageout.c		- Modified vm_pageout.c kernel source file
big.cc                  - C++ source file for benchmark

-----------------------------------
Source Files changed/explanation

vm/vm_pageout.c
  - Majority of the changes take place in function vm_pageout_scan().

    - vm_pageout_scan() iterates through the inactive queue, placing
      pages into the laundry queue one-by-one until the page deficit is
      supplemented.

    - Marker pages, held pages, and busy pages are skipped over. This
      design decision was suggested by Professor Nawab. Through the
      majority of our tests, this has caused no irregularities to FIFO
      page ordering, but, in rare cases, cause incontinuities.

    - Removed all functionality that scans the active page queue, since
      it will always be empty.

    - Removed functionality of transferring referenced pages into
      the active queue.
      
  - Changes outside of vm_pageout_scan are meant to funnel pages into
    the inactive queue that would be placed in the active queue
    otherwise.
    
vm/vm_page.c
  - All changes in this file are meant to serve one of two purposes:
    - Redirect pages from the active queue to the inactive queue.
    - update an incoming page's page count. 

  - variable static unsigned long pg_cnt is a global monotinically
    increasing counter that tracks the number of pages that have
    entered the FIFO page queue. This variable tracks page order within
    the queue, and is the key mechanism for displaying proper FIFO
    functionality.
-----------------------------------
Benchmark:

  Build:
    $ make benchmark
  Run (as Root):
    $ ./benchmark

  Description:
    Allocates a large amount of memory to force virtual memory.
    Then accesses the memory three different ways. The third way will
    thrash and cause many page faults. 
  Results:
    Following the completion of
    the thrashing run, pageout queue messages printed to the system
    log will be analyzed to ensure FIFO queue. Any discrepencies will
    be reported and assumed to be special pages. For the most part, 
    the end page minus the starting page will be the number of pages
    in the queue.
