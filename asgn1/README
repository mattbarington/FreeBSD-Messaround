Hi, thanks for taking the time to look at this project. I hope you
enjoy grading this as much as I enjoyed building it.

Files:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Makefile:	  used for building the executable 'argshell',
   		  cleaning up the directory of excess files, and
		  jumping straight into execution after making.

 - argshell.c: 	  The main codebase for the shell. Everything in
   	       	  'argshell.c' is built by myself alone.

 - shell.l:    	  File provided at the beginning of the project. It 
   	       	  is used to read input into the shell using
		  yylex().

 - designDoc.txt: High level design and organization of the program.
   		  For a closer look at how each function works check
		  the code base; each function has a documentation
		  block, and larger functions have inline comments.

 - README: 	  Some pleasant reading material describing how to
   		  compile and run this shell imitation.
		  


How to compile and run:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 - compiling: The Makefile should do all of the heavy lifting. Just
   	      type 'make' to compile the codebase into an executable
	      called 'argshell'.

 - running:   The makefile also provides a tool for running. Type
   	      'make run' to compile into an executable 'argshell'
	      and immediately launch.
	      The executable can also be run directly with
	      './argshell after compilation.
