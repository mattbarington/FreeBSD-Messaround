Hi, thanks for taking the time to look at this project. I hope you
enjoy grading this as much as I enjoyed building it.

Files:
 - Makefile:   used for building the executable 'argshell', cleaning
   	       up the directory of excess files, and jumping straigh
	       into execution after making.

 - argshell.c: The main codebase for the shell. Everything in
   	       'argshell.c' is built by myself alone.

 - shell.l:    File provided at the beginning of the project. It is
   	       used to read input into the shell using yylex().

How to compile and run:
 - compiling: The Makefile should do all of the heavy lifting. Just
   	      type 'make' to compile the codebase into an executable
	      called 'argshell'.

 - running:   The makefile also provides a tool for running. Type
   	      'make run' to compile into an executable 'argshell'
	      and immediately launch.
	      The executable can also be run directly with
	      './argshell after compilation.
