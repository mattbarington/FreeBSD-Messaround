                      make build also support multicore compilation.

                          If omitted CORES defaults to 1.
 - make copyFiles   - copies all kernel files from kern/ and sys/ 
                      to the corresponding files in the kernel.
                      Does not build kernel.
 - make install     - installs the compiled kernel.
 
 
 How to install:
 - Compile - If you have allocated more than 1 CPU to your VM you can
            compile kernel faster with
